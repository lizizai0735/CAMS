## 🎯 Competition Overview

Accurate and reliable quantification of ultrasound parameters is fundamental to disease diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and evidence-based clinical decision-making across prenatal, pediatric, and adult populations. However, current clinical practice still relies heavily on manual or semi-automated measurements, which remain time-consuming, operator-dependent, and prone to substantial inter- and intra-observer variability.

FU_Biometry aims to establish the first large-scale, unified ultrasound biometry benchmark capable of automatically measuring more than 20 key ultrasound parameters spanning prenatal, intrapartum, and routine adult ultrasound.

## 🔮 Local Inference

### Using model.py

Modify the paths in `model.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    data_root = '/path/to/your/data'  # Change to your data path
    output_dir = 'predictions/'
    batch_size = 4
    
    model = Model()
    model.predict(data_root, output_dir, batch_size=batch_size)
```

Then run:

```bash
python model.py
```

### Expected Output Structure

```
predictions/
├── regression_predictions.json     # Regression results
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Mean Radial Error (MRE)** | 50% | Average distance between predicted and ground truth landmarks |
| **Parameter Error** | 50% | Absolute difference between predicted and manually measured parameters |

### MRE Calculation

For each case with K required landmarks:
```
MRE = (1/K) * Σ ||p_k - g_k||_2
```
where `p_k` is the predicted landmark and `g_k` is the ground truth landmark.

### Ranking Method

- Final rankings use a ChallengeR-style rank-then-aggregate framework
- Domain-balanced weighting across four data domains
- Both overall and domain-stratified leaderboards are reported
- Tie-breaking: priority given to method with lower normalized parameter error

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. About model.py

**`model.py` is the core file!** You can freely modify its internal implementation, but must follow these specifications:

#### Required Interface

```python
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize model"""
        pass
    
    def predict(self, data_root: str, output_dir: str, batch_size: int = 8):
        """
        Perform inference
        
        Args:
            data_root: Input data root directory (/input/ in Docker)
            output_dir: Output directory (/output/ in Docker)
            batch_size: Batch size
        """
        pass
```

#### Output Format Requirements

##### 1) Landmark Predictions Output

**Format**: JSON file

**Path**: `{output_dir}/landmark_predictions.json`

**Content**:
```json
[
  {
    "image_path": "relative/path/image_001.jpg",
    "task_id": "id",
    "predicted_points_normalized": [0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7],
    "predicted_points_pixels": [150, 200, 300, 350]
  },
  ...
]
```

**Description**:
- `predicted_points_normalized`: Normalized landmark coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2, ...) in range [0, 1]
- `predicted_points_pixels`: Pixel coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2, ...) in original image space

### 2. Multi-task Model Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: Participants are required to develop a **unified model** capable of handling all subgroups and imaging domains within the challenge. 

- ❌ Subgroup-specific models are NOT permitted
- ❌ Separate submissions for individual tasks are NOT permitted
- ✅ Each team must submit a single integrated solution

### 3. Baseline Comparison Requirement

An official baseline model will be provided by the organizers. Submitted methods must demonstrate **performance improvements over this baseline** to be eligible for ranking and awards.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q1: How to modify model architecture?

**A**: You can freely modify the model structure in `model_factory.py`, but make sure:
- Input: Ultrasound images (various sizes)
- Output: Landmark coordinates and derived parameters
- The model must handle all clinical domains

### Q2: What if I run out of GPU memory during training?

**A**: Reduce the batch size:
```python
# train.py
BATCH_SIZE = 4  # Change from 4 to 2
```

### Q3: Can I use semi-supervised learning?

**A**: Yes! The training set contains 5,000 unlabeled images specifically designed to support semi-supervised learning strategies. This reflects real-world clinical conditions where expert annotation is limited.

### Q4: How to handle different imaging views?

**A**: Each image is associated with a predefined landmark template specifying which landmarks are applicable. Not all clinical parameters apply to every image.

### Q5: Can I use my own pre-trained model?

**A**: Yes! Model weight files are included in the Docker image. You can use foundation models or pre-trained weights.

### Q6: How to verify if output format is correct?

**A**: 
1. Run Docker on validation set
2. Upload output to CodaLab platform
3. Platform will automatically validate format and return evaluation results

### Q7: What is the clinical significance of the metrics?

**A**: 
- MRE < 5mm is generally considered clinically acceptable for most ultrasound measurements
- Parameter errors within 5-10% of expert measurements are considered good
- These thresholds are based on inter-observer variability in clinical practice
